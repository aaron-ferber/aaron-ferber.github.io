I'm Aaron Ferber, a researcher, engineer, and community builder bridging the gaps between AI, science, and society. I'm currently a postdoc at Cornell University working with Carla Gomes in the [CU AI for Science Institute](https://science.ai.cornell.edu/).

I'm passionate about solving impactful real-world problems with elegant and efficient solutions. My research experience focuses on end-to-end integration of deep learning and automated reasoning, with applications in several domains such as wildlife trafficking, invasive species management, neuroscience, photonic design, recommendation systems, finance, and more. 

I received my PhD from the University of Southern California, advised by Prof. [Bistra Dilkina](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Dilkina/Bistra), working in the [Center for AI in Society (CAIS)](https://www.cais.usc.edu/), with a disseration titled ["Artificial Decision Intelligence: Integrating Deep Learning and Combinatorial Optimization"](https://digitallibrary.usc.edu/Share/4x43xxm5iqop28mjh0qu8u5003403033).

Outside of research I enjoy raquet sports, climbing, cooking, sailing, diving, and pretty much anything outdoors. I'm always looking for new things in research and recreation so reach out and let's do something!
